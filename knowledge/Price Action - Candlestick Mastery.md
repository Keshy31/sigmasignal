# Price Action: Candlestick Mastery

> [!SUMMARY] Purpose
> While indicators (RSI, MACD, Bollinger) provide the **Context**, Price Action provides the **Trigger**.
> * **Core Philosophy:** Candlesticks tell the story of the "War for Territory" between Buyers (Bulls) and Sellers (Bears).
> * **Goal:** To pinpoint the exact entry signal *after* the setup is complete.

## 1. The Anatomy of a Candle
![[candlestick_components.jpeg]]

The structure of a single candle reveals the winner of that specific time period.

* **The Body (Conquered Territory):** Where the price started (Open) and ended (Close). A large body indicates conviction.
* **The Wick/Shadow (Failed Invasion):** Where the price went, but got pushed back. This represents rejection.

> [!NOTE] 🧠 Mental Model: The Battlefield
> View every candle as a battle for land.
> * **Green Body:** Bulls pushed the Bears back and held the ground.
> * **Long Upper Wick:** Bulls tried to invade higher territory, but Bears counter-attacked and forced a retreat. (Weakness)
> * **Long Lower Wick:** Bears tried to invade lower territory, but Bulls defended the line. (Strength).

## 2. Reversal Patterns (The Turn)
These patterns signal that the current trend is hitting a wall and is about to reverse.

### A. The Hammer (Bullish Rejection) 🔨
![[hammer-candlestick.jpeg]]
* **Context:** Must occur at the **Bottom** of a downtrend or at Support.
* **Shape:** Small body, long lower wick (at least 2x the size of the body).
* **The Story ("The Trampoline"):** Bears pushed price down hard, but Bulls rejected the lower prices and forced a close near the highs.
* **Action:** **Buy** (Long) if this forms at a Key Level.

### B. The Shooting Star (Bearish Rejection) 🌠
* **Context:** Must occur at the **Top** of an uptrend or at Resistance.
* **Shape:** Small body, long upper wick.
* **The Story ("The Pinocchio/Bull Trap"):** Bulls tried to break out, but were slapped back down. A failed rally.
* **Action:** **Sell** (Short).

## 3. Momentum Patterns (The Shift)
These patterns indicate a massive injection of volume and a shift in power.

### C. Bullish Engulfing (The Takeover)

* **Structure:** A small Red candle followed by a massive Green candle that completely "swallows" the previous body.
* **The Story ("Pac-Man"):** Buying pressure is so intense it completely erases the previous period's selling. A major power shift.

### D. Bearish Engulfing (The Crash)

* **Structure:** A small Green candle followed by a massive Red candle that swallows it.
* **The Story:** The Bears have overwhelmed the Bulls.

## 4. Indecision Patterns (The Pause)

### E. The Doji ➕
![[doji_candlestick.jpeg]]
* **Structure:** Open and Close are virtually identical. Looks like a cross.
* **The Story ("Tug-of-War"):** Stalemate. Neither side won the battle.

> [!WARNING] Rule of Engagement
> **Do not trade a Doji alone.**
> It signals a potential change, but requires **confirmation**. You must wait for the next candle to see who breaks the deadlock.

## 5. The "Perfect Trade" Execution
*Never trade a candlestick in the middle of nowhere. Context is King.*

This is how Candlesticks integrate with the **Trading Trinity**.

> [!CHECK] The Execution Checklist
> 1.  **Zone (The "Where"):** Price hits a Key Level, such as a Support/Resistance line or the **Lower [[Bollinger Bands]]**.
> 2.  **Filter (The "Why"):** Momentum is favorable.
>     * Is [[Relative Strength Index (RSI)|RSI]] showing **Divergence**?
>     * Is [[MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence)|MACD]] slowing down?
> 3.  **Trigger (The "When"):** A **Hammer** or **Bullish Engulfing** forms exactly at that level.
> 4.  **Entry:** Enter on the **Close** of the trigger candle, or the **Break** of its high.
