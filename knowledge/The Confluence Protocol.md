# The Complete Trading System: The "Confluence" Protocol

> [!SUMMARY] Goal
> To identify high-probability trades by stacking evidence (**Confluence**) and executing with strict mathematical safety.
> This system integrates **The Trinity** (Context), **Price Action** (Trigger), and **Risk Management** (Safety).

## Phase 1: The Setup (The Landscape)
*Look for these conditions before considering a trade.*

### 1. [[Bollinger Bands]] (Volatility)
* **The Question:** Is the market squeezing or extended?
* **The Signal:**
    * **The Squeeze:** Bands are tight (Soda Bottle). Watch for a breakout.
    * **The Extension:** Price is at the Upper/Lower Band. Watch for mean reversion.

### 2. [[MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence)|MACD]] (Trend Direction)
* **The Question:** Is the wind at my back?
* **The Signal:**
    * **Bullish:** Line > Signal Line (Green Histogram).
    * **Bearish:** Line < Signal Line (Red Histogram).
    * **Zero Line:** Above 0 = Bull Market / Below 0 = Bear Market.

### 3. [[Relative Strength Index (RSI)|RSI]] (Momentum Health)
* **The Question:** Is the move healthy or exhausted?
* **The Signal:**
    * **Divergence:** Price makes Highs, RSI makes Lows (Reversal Imminent).
    * **Overbought/Oversold:** Watch for 70/30, but wait for the turn.

## Phase 2: The Trigger (Price Action)
*Do not enter until a specific candle confirms the Phase 1 thesis.*
*Reference:* [[Price Action - Candlestick Mastery]]

### Reversal Patterns (Bounce Plays)
* **Hammer:** Long lower wick at Support (Bullish).
* **Shooting Star:** Long upper wick at Resistance (Bearish).
* **Engulfing:** A massive candle "swallows" the previous one (Momentum Shift).

### Continuation Patterns (Breakout Plays)
* **Marubozu:** A big solid candle breaking through a Bollinger Band Squeeze.

---

## Phase 3: The Execution (Risk Management)
*The mathematical safety net.*
*Reference:* [[Risk Management & Position Sizing]]

### 1. The 1% Rule
* **Rule:** Never risk more than **1% of Total Account Equity** on a single trade.

### 2. The Stop Loss
* **Placement:** Must be placed at a "technical invalidation point" (e.g., just below the Hammer's wick or below the Support floor).
* *Note:* If the price hits this level, your thesis was wrong. Get out.

### 3. Position Sizing (The Formula)
$$Shares = \frac{\text{Account Risk (\$)}}{\text{Entry Price} - \text{Stop Loss Price}}$$

## ✅ The "Perfect Trade" Checklist
*If you cannot check all boxes, **DO NOT** take the trade.*

- [ ] **Context:** Is Price at a Key Level (Support/Resistance)?
- [ ] **Volatility:** Are [[Bollinger Bands]] showing a setup (Squeeze or Reversion)?
- [ ] **Momentum:** Is [[Relative Strength Index (RSI)|RSI]] showing Divergence or a valid reset?
- [ ] **Trend:** Does [[MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence)|MACD]] support the direction?
- [ ] **Trigger:** Did a Hammer/Star/Engulfing candle close?
- [ ] **Risk:** Have I calculated my position size to risk only 1%?
