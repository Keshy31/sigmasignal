## 1. The Decision Matrix

| Indicator | Role | Key Question |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Bollinger Bands** | **Context** | "Is the market sleeping (Squeeze) or running (Expansion)?" |
| **RSI** | **Timing** | "Is the move exhausted (Divergence) or just starting (Breakout)?" |
| **MACD** | **Confirmation** | "Does the trend support my trade?" |

## 2. Execution Scenarios

### Scenario A: The Mean Reversion (Buying the Dip)
*Use this when the market is **Ranging** (Bands are flat/horizontal).*

> [!CHECK] Long Setup Checklist
> - [ ] **Bollinger:** Price touches or pierces the **Lower Band** (The Rumble Strip).
> - [ ] **RSI:** Is **Oversold (<30)** OR showing **Bullish Divergence**.
> - [ ] **MACD:** Histogram is ticking up (dark red $\to$ light red) or crossing over.
> - [ ] **Action:** BUY.
> - [ ] **Target:** The Middle Band (20 SMA).


### Scenario B: The Breakout (Catching the Trend)
*Use this when the market has been **Quiet** (Squeeze) and is waking up.*

> [!CHECK] Long Setup Checklist
> - [ ] **Bollinger:** Bands were tight (Soda Bottle), now Price closes strongly **Above Upper Band**.
> - [ ] **RSI:** Breaks **Above 70** (Confirming high velocity).
> - [ ] **MACD:** Fast Line crosses above Slow Line (Bullish Cross).
> - [ ] **Action:** BUY and TRAIL STOP.
> - [ ] **Exit:** When Price closes back inside the bands or MACD crosses bearish.

## 3. The "Trap" Warnings (Red Flags)

> [!DANGER] STOP! Do Not Trade If:
> 1.  **The Fake-Out:** Price breaks the Bollinger Band, but [[Relative Strength Index (RSI)|RSI]] stays flat near 50. (No Momentum = Trap).
> 2.  **The Falling Knife:** Price hits the Lower Bollinger Band, but the bands are expanding aggressively (Alligator Mouth). *Momentum is too strong to fade.*
> 3.  **The Signal Lag:** [[MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence)|MACD]] crosses, but Price is already at a major resistance level. (Too late to the party).

## 4. Daily Routine
1.  **Scan for Squeezes:** Look for assets where [[Bollinger Bands (The Volatility Map)|Bollinger Bands]] are visibly tight. Add to Watchlist.
2.  **Check Momentum:** On your watchlist, is [[Relative Strength Index (RSI)|RSI]] showing divergence?
3.  **Verify Trend:** Use [[MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence)|MACD]] to confirm the direction before pulling the trigger.
